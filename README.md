## Future Plans

I'm exploring several new development opportunities to enhance this configuration:

- **Rust & Lua Utilities**: Planning to develop additional utility scripts in these languages for better performance and flexibility
- **Swift CLI Timer App**: Working on a terminal-based timer to encourage regular movement throughout the day

These projects will not only improve my productivity but also serve as valuable learning experiences in languages I'm looking to master.
